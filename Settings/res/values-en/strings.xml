STAMINA mode is a Sony™ power save function. It extends battery lifetime by disabling functionality while the screen is off.

"<u>Basic usage</u>"
To activate STAMINA mode, tap the button below. Note that a restart is required.
When the screen is off, Wi-Fi and mobile data will be temporarily disabled, and most of your applications will be inactive, to save battery.
When the screen is on, your phone will function normally.

"<u>Advanced usage</u>"
If you want to keep some apps active when the screen is off, just add them to the APPS ACTIVE IN STANDBY list.

"<u>Note</u>"
Some applications may not work properly when disabled in standby. If an application does not work properly, add it to the APPS ACTIVE IN STANDBY list, or if this does not work, deactivate STAMINA mode."</string>
